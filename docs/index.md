# What is Buggregator?

Buggregator is a free, multi-purpose server tool designed primarily for debugging PHP applications, but it's also
compatible with other programming languages. Think of it as a Swiss Army knife for developers. What makes it special is
that it offers a range of features that you would usually find in various paid tools, but it's available for free.

One of the coolest things about Buggregator is how well it fits into Docker environments. If you're working with Docker,
it is like a dream come true. It's easy to integrate and really powerful.

The key feature of Buggregator is its ability to bring together debugging information from different services. This
means you can see all your debugging data in one place, which makes fixing bugs a whole lot easier and faster. It's a
great tool for any developer looking to streamline their debugging process without spending a lot of money.

## Centralized Debugging with Buggregator

1. **Unified Debugging Dashboard**: Buggregator allows you to aggregate logs, dumps, and other debug information from
   all your services into a single, unified interface. This centralization of data is invaluable for developers who
   manage multiple services or microservices, as it simplifies tracking and analysis.

2. **Cross-Service Debugging**: It eliminates the need to toggle between different tools or logs, saving time and
   reducing complexity.

3. **Real-Time Monitoring on Various Devices**: You can open its GUI on different devices, such as a tablet, and observe
   all the debug information in real-time.

4. **Ease of Access and Use**: By integrating Buggregator into your Docker development infrastructure, you set up a
   system where all debug information is automatically sent to Buggregator's server.
