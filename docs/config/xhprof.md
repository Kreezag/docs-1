# Configuration â€” Xhprof profiler

The Xhprof profiler is an essential feature of Buggregator that offers a lightweight and hierarchical profiling solution
for PHP applications. It uses instrumentation to keep track of call counts and inclusive metrics for arcs in the dynamic
callgraph of your program during the data collection phase. In the reporting and post-processing phase, the profiler
computes exclusive metrics such as wall (elapsed) time, CPU time, and memory usage.

With the Xhprof profiler, you can easily identify performance bottlenecks and optimize your application's code for
better efficiency. So, if you're looking to fine-tune your PHP application's performance, the Xhprof profiler is the
perfect tool for the job.

## Installation extension

One of the way to install Xhprof is to use [PECL](https://pecl.php.net/package/xhprof) package.

```bash
pear channel-update pear.php.net
pecl install xhprof
```

## Configuration

After installing the package, you need to configure it. The package provides predefined environment variables to
configure the profiler.

```dotenv
PROFILER_ENDPOINT=http://profiler@127.0.0.1:8000
PROFILER_APP_NAME="My super app"
```

## Client configuration

When integrating with Buggregator, especially if you're developing a custom client, it's essential to understand how to
correctly configure the data transmission. This guide outlines various methods to designate your requests as xhprof
requests

### Using HTTP auth

Add `profiler` to the host name, e.g. `http://profiler@...`

### Using header

Add a header `X-Buggregator-Event` with value `profiler` or just add `X-Profiler-Dump` with any value.

### Special endpoint

You can use special endpoint `/profiler/store` to send data to Buggregator.
