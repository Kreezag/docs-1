# Configuration â€” Xhprof profiler

The Xhprof profiler is an essential feature of Buggregator that offers a lightweight and hierarchical profiling solution
for PHP applications. It uses instrumentation to keep track of call counts and inclusive metrics for arcs in the dynamic
callgraph of your program during the data collection phase. In the reporting and post-processing phase, the profiler
computes exclusive metrics such as wall (elapsed) time, CPU time, and memory usage.

With the Xhprof profiler, you can easily identify performance bottlenecks and optimize your application's code for
better efficiency. So, if you're looking to fine-tune your PHP application's performance, the Xhprof profiler is the
perfect tool for the job.
