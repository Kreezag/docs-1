# Contributing â€” Documentation

Buggregator uses [VitePress](https://vitepress.dev/) for its documentation. This makes it easy to contribute to the
project's documentation by following the steps below.

## Getting Started

### Clone the Repository

First of all you need to clone the repository to your local machine.

```bash
git clone git@github.com:buggregator/docs.git
```

> **Note**: If you don't have access to the repository, you can fork it and clone your forked repository.

### Install Dependencies

After cloning the repository, navigate to the project directory and install the dependencies.

```bash
npm install
```

### Start the Development Server

To start the development server and preview the documentation, run the following command:

```bash
npm run docs:dev
```

This command will start a local development server and open the documentation in your default browser.

## Structure

The documentation is structured as follows:

- `docs/`: Contains the documentation files.
- `docs/.vitepress/config.mts`: Site configuration and navigation.

All you need is to edit the markdown files in the `docs/` directory. If you want to add a new page, create a new
markdown file in the `docs/` directory and add it to the navigation in the `docs/.vitepress/config.mts` file.

That's it! You're now ready to contribute to the Buggregator documentation.
